TASK 3: Inserting 12 into the AVL Tree (10, 5, 15, 3, 7)

1. Insert 10, 5, 15.
2. Insert 3: Node 10 becomes unbalanced (BF=2).
   -> Right Rotation on 10. Root becomes 5.
3. Insert 7: 7 goes to the left of 10.
   Height = 2.

1.
Path: 5 -> 10 -> 15.
12 is inserted as the Left Child of 15.

Step 2, 3. Calculate BF, Check Height, and Status.

| Node | BF (hL - hR) | Status |
|      |              |        |
| 15   | 1 - 0 = 1    |Balanced|
| 10   | 1 - 2 = -1   |Balanced|
| 5    | 1 - 3 = -2   |UNBALANCED|

Height of the unbalanced tree is 3 (e.g., 5 -> 10 -> 15 -> 12).

---
4.
Imbalance: Root 5 (BF = -2). This is a Right-Left (RL) Double Rotation case (5 -> 10 -> 15 -> 12).

1. Right Rotation on 15 (child of 10): 12 replaces 15's position.
   (Subtree 10: L: 7, R: 12. 12's R: 15)
2. Left Rotation on 5 (Root): 10 replaces 5's position.
   (5 becomes left child of 10. 7 becomes right child of 5.)

5.
Final Balanced AVL Tree Structure:
    Root: 10
    Left Child of 10: 5
        Left Child of 5: 3
        Right Child of 5: 7
    Right Child of 10: 15
        Left Child of 15: 12
    Final Height: 2
