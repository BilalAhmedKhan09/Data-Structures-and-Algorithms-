TASK 1: Inserting Student 15 into an AVL Tree

Initial AVL Tree Structure (10, 20, 30, 40, 50):
Root: 30
Left Subtree: 10 (Left child of 30), 20 (Right child of 10)
Right Subtree: 40 (Right child of 30), 50 (Right child of 40)

1.
Balance Check and Rotation:
    Node 10 becomes unbalanced (BF = -2). This is a Right-Left (RL) imbalance (10 -> 20 -> 15).
    To correct, a Right Rotation on 20 followed by a Left Rotation on 10 is performed. The node 15 becomes the new local root of this subtree.

2.
* The height of the resulting AVL tree is 2.

3. 
Final Balanced AVL Tree Structure:
    Root: 30
    Left Child of 30: 15
        Left Child of 15: 10
        Right Child of 15: 20
    Right Child of 30: 40
        Right Child of 40: 50
