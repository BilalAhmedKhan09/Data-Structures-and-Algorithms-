// A queue is an ideal data structure because it operates based on the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, meaning the first item added is the first one to be processed.

// How it works:

// Enqueue: Add a new item (order with its quantity) to the back of the queue.

// Dequeue: Remove an order from the front of the queue once it's processed.

// Preventing Issues:

// Overflow: Use a dynamic queue (like a linked list) that grows as needed to handle more orders.

// Underflow: Before dequeuing, check if the queue is empty to avoid trying to remove an item from an empty queue.

// Printing Orders:

// Each order should be printed as it is dequeued, displaying the sequence in which they were received.
